## ApeCoin Proposal Generator 

A tool designed to streamline the process of creating Ape Improvement Proposals. 

It works by collecting a series of inputs from the user—ranging from short phrases to more detailed sentences—to craft proposals tailored to the Ape Coin ecosystem. These inputs include elements such as the Title, Proposal Category, Team Description, as well as a list of Benefits to the ApeCoin System, Utilized Platforms and Technologies, Implementation Steps, Key Milestones, and the Overall Cost. 

The more detailed and numerous the inputs, the higher the quality of the proposal generated. The output of the tool is designed to meet the ApeCoin community’s proposal formatting guidelines. The tool is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model and hosted on Vercel.
